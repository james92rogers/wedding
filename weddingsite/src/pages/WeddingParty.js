                <p>
                  Tarkin will be easy to spot on the day because he will be the
                  sharpest looking person there. James and Tarkin met in 2014
                  while both <span className={"italic"}>temporarily</span>{" "}
                  working for QVC. Fast forward a few years and they were both
                  managers of their respective teams, fighting side by side in
                  meetings, relying on each other for advice (although it was
                  almost always James who needed it), and making sure they never
                  missed a lunch together (which had its own opening ceremony).
                  They are both part of what others refer to as 'The Wrestling
                  Crew' and even flew out to America to fulfill their dream of
                  watching Wrestlemania live.

                    The younger brother of the groom, Henry and James have spent
                    many years (well, their entire lives really)
                    discussing/arguing about music, sports, movies, games, and
                    anything else they can think about. Luckily, whenever a
                    disagreement is too big, their shared loved of Plymouth
                    Argyle manages to restore the peace.

                    The older brother of the groom, Ed and James enjoy spending
                    their time teaming up to take the mick out of whoever is
                    nearest them... so most of the time that happens to be
                    Henry. Now they talk to each other almost entirely in the
                    form of memes or using quotes from old Simpsons episodes.

                    The nephew of the bride, Ronnie will likely claim he has
                    defeated James at football in the garden, Badminton at
                    Center Parcs, or wrestling in the swimming pool, but he
                    would be lying about all of these things. He also likes to
                    say to James that Chelsea are better than Plymouth Argyle,
                    but this too is obviously untrue.

                    Aidan and James first met when Aidan took a job that James
                    was after. They should have been enemies, but instead the
                    two of them formed an alliance based on a love of drinking,
                    eating fast food, and playing air guitars on the sofa to
                    Fall Out Boy. When around each other, expect to hear
                    terrible Australian accents, as well as the phrases 'Awww
                    yeah' and 'Ya drongo' used frequently.

                <p>
                  Sophie and Steph met when Sophie patiently trained Steph in
                  the ways of floor managing all the way back in 2016 and
                  quickly became firm friends. Sharing their interest in live
                  comedy and travel, they loved going to the Fringe Festival in
                  Edinburgh (although covid put a stop to that!) Sophie clearly
                  took leave of her senses when she agreed to move in with Steph
                  and James and spent nearly 4 years being the best housemate,
                  argument adjudicator, and covid buddy anyone could ask for.
                  When it was time for James to propose, Sophie was instrumental
                  in organising the proposal and double checking the ring!

                    John is one of Stephâ€™s oldest friends, meeting in first year
                    of University they became more like siblings than friends.
                    After playing silly pranks on each other, mostly John on
                    Steph, too many nights out, and the occasional session in
                    the library, John and Steph were best idiots forever! 13
                    years later, after many trips up and down the country to see
                    each other and support each other's lives, Steph could not
                    imagine walking down the aisle without John there to mock
                    her the whole way (and maybe say something supportive!)

                    Another University survivor, Sam and Steph connected via a
                    Facebook group (remember them?!) before starting way back in
                    2009 and the rest was history. They share a love of the
                    theatre, art, Eurovision, and love to sing songs from
                    musicals and the 90s (mostly in key!) From the dreadful uni
                    houses in Chester to trips to New York and Amsterdam and
                    everything in between, they have laughed the whole way
                    through.

                    Stacey made a lasting impression on Steph the first time
                    they met by shouting at a notoriously annoying lighting guy!
                    Then years later, they moved onto the same shift and have
                    been friends ever since. They have shared many drunken times
                    together, including a trip to Brussels, many bbq's, and
                    Christmas dinners! Stacey has always been amazing to Steph
                    and even had the patience to train Steph in the ways of
                    directing.
